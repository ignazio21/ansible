# Modify the DEFAULT ROLES PATH
# From the Ansible configuration file

# This is useful for following reasons
-> shared path for multiple developers
-> different path playbook/roles

$vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

-> Set "roles_path" to the path where ROLES are now defined
-> Example
roles_path = /home/vagrant/playbook/roles/
