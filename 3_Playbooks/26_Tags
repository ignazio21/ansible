# Using tags we can say to RUN or SKIP something in particular to the YAML file
# The following will run only the VERIFICATION

$ansible-playbook tags.yml --tags "verification"

# The following instead we say to RUN the installation of PACKAGES

$ansible-playbook tags.yml --tags "packages"

# TO SKIP instead

$ansible-playbook tags.yml --skip-tags "packages"

# To RUN ALWAYS instead of specific skipped
# This means that even if we RUN --tags "packages", the tag "always" will however RUN too
